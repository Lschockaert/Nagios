#Nagios

This is a working version of Nagios, fully configured with ansible working on centos7.
To be able to use this on windows we are using an ansible skeleton.

To adapt this to your own host and servers, change the configfiles which are loaded automatically in the right place.

This is part of an assignment we made during our project in university college.
